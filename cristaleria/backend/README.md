### Starting the Server

To start the server, you need to perform the following steps:

1. Install Node.js and npm on your computer. You can download and install Node.js from the official website: <https://nodejs.org/>
2. Once you have installed Node.js and npm, you can proceed to install the necessary packages for your server. This may include packages such as Express, a popular web framework for Node.js. You can install packages using npm by typing `npm install` in the terminal.
3. After you have installed the necessary packages, you can start your server by typing `npm start` in the terminal. This command will start the server and allow you to access it through your web browser on <http://localhost:3000/doc/swagger>
